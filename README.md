# SYNOPSIS

```go

import "github.com/lestrrat-go/backoff"

func Func(arg Foo) (Result, error) { ... }

var policy = backoff.NewExponential(
  backoff.WithInterval(500*time.Millisecond), // base interval
  backoff.WithJitterFactor(0.05), // 5% jitter
  backoff.WithMaxRetries(25),
)
func RetryFunc(arg Foo) (Result, error) {
  b, cancel := policy.Start(context.Background())
  defer cancel()

  for backoff.Continue(b) {
    res, err := Func(arg)
    if err == nil {
      return res, nil
    }
  }
  return nil, errors.New(`tried very hard, but no luck`)
}
```

## Simple Usage

```go
func ExampleRetry() {
  count := 0
  e := backoff.ExecuteFunc(func(_ context.Context) error {
    // This is a silly example that succeeds on every 10th try
    count++
    if count%10 == 0 {
      return nil
    }
    return errors.New(`dummy`)
  })

  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
  defer cancel()

  p := backoff.NewExponential()
  if err := backoff.Retry(ctx, p, e); err != nil {
    log.Printf("failed to call function after repeated tries")
  }
}
```

# DESCRIPTION

This library is an implementation of backoff algorithm for retrying operations
in an idiomatic Go way. It respects `context.Context` natively, and the critical
notifications are done through *channel operations*, allowing you to write code 
that is both more explicit and flexibile.

It also exports a utility function `Retry`, for simple operations.

# TODO

* Refine the timeouts generated by exponential backoff algorithm (help wanted!)

# PRIOR ARTS

## [github.com/cenkalti/backoff](https://github.com/cenkalti/backoff) 

This library is featureful, but one thing that gets to me is the fact that
it essentially forces you to create a closure over the operation to be retried.

## [github.com/jpillora/backoff](https://github.com/jpillora/backoff)

This library is a very simple implementation of calculating backoff durations.
I wanted it to let me know when to stop too, so it was missing a few things.
